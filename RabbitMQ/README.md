# Tutorial - RabbitMQ in .Net

RabbitMQ is a great messagbroker. To use it directly is hard, especially in cases of error handling. So there are some popular libraries which I will quick try out.
There is one solution which includes all examples under a separate folder. The script folder contains some scripts to deploy RabbitMQ and executes the port forwarding.

## Requirements
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.Net 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Windows Terminal to script port forwarding](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

## Install and Start RabbitMQ
 
 
 ```console
